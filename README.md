# Video-To-Defcon-Furs-Badge

VideoToBadge.py converts a video file to a compressed binary file. video.py uses the binary file to play that video on a 7 x 14 pixel RGB LED badge made by Defcon Furs.

It looks terrible, it doesn't have any sound, and you can barely tell that a video is being played. But I achieved my goal of playing full motion video on a small badge with 4MB of storage that was only intended to play simple pixel animations.


The badge that this script was made for: https://github.com/defconfurs/dcfurs-badge-dc27
